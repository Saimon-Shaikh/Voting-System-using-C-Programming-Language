# 🗳️ Voting System Project using C Language

## 🌟 Project Overview
The Voting System is a console-based application built using the C programming language. It provides a secure, interactive platform to cast, manage, and track votes for candidates in an election. The system offers various features such as vote casting, vote counting, displaying leading candidates, resetting votes, and declaring the winner. Certain actions like resetting votes or declaring the winner are password-protected to ensure only authorized users can perform them. This project demonstrates key concepts such as user input handling, decision-making, and file handling in C programming, with a focus on user-friendly error handling and security features.

### Key Features:
1. ✅ **Vote Casting**: 
- Users can choose one of the four candidates to cast their vote. 
- The system records the vote and thanks the voter for their participation.

2. 📊 **Vote Counting**:
- Provides a summary of the votes cast for each candidate, including the number of spoiled votes.

3. 🌟 **Displaying Leading Candidates**:
- Users can view candidates sorted by the number of votes received, providing a clear view of who is leading in the election.

4. 🔄 **Resetting Votes**:
 - Only authorized users can reset the vote counts to zero. The system requires a password to access this feature for added security.

5. 🏆 **Declaring the Winner**
 - Allows users to declare the winner of the election after entering the correct password. The winner is announced with an attractive message, and ties are indicated clearly.


6. **Exit with Confirmation:**
   - Asks for confirmation before exiting to prevent accidental termination.

7. **Enhanced Error Handling:**
   - Handles incorrect inputs gracefully and prompts users to re-enter their choices, ensuring smooth operation even with invalid data entry.

# 🌟 Key Concepts Implemented 🌟:
- 🔒 **Password Protection:**
Restricts sensitive actions (like resetting votes and declaring a winner) to authorized users only.

- 📊 **Sorting and Ranking:**
Candidates are sorted based on votes using a simple sorting algorithm.

- ✅ **User Input Validation:**
Safely handles user input to prevent crashes or undefined behavior.

- 🎉 **Dynamic Display:**
Results and winner announcements are presented in an engaging format.

- 🔄 **Control Flow and Decision Making:**
Utilizes conditional statements, loops, and switch-case statements for application flow control.

## 🌟 Technical Skills Demonstrated

- **C Programming:** 🖥️ Proficiency in functions, arrays, conditionals, loops, and string manipulation.
- **Error Handling:** ✅ Effective validation techniques ensure input integrity.
- **Password Authentication:** 🔒 Simple security feature implementation for sensitive actions.
- **User Interaction Design:** 🎨 Clear prompts enhance user navigation and experience.
